# Level 2: Algebra - Core Manipulation Layer

## Overview

Algebra is the language of mathematics that allows us to express relationships, solve problems, and manipulate abstract quantities. For software engineers venturing into machine learning, algebra serves as the foundational grammar that makes everything from simple linear regression to complex neural network optimization possible.

## Why Algebra Matters for Machine Learning

Machine learning is, at its core, about finding mathematical relationships in data. Every ML algorithm relies on algebraic concepts:

- **Variables** represent features, weights, and predictions
- **Equations** define models and loss functions
- **Polynomials** appear in kernel methods and activation functions
- **Exponentials and logarithms** power probability distributions and information theory
- **Inequalities** define constraints in optimization problems

Without a solid understanding of algebra, ML concepts become black boxes. With it, you gain the power to understand, debug, and innovate.

## Chapter Structure

### [Chapter 1: Variables and Expressions](./01-variables-and-expressions.md)
The building blocks of algebraic thinking. Learn to distinguish between unknowns, parameters, and constants—concepts that directly map to features, hyperparameters, and fixed values in ML.

### [Chapter 2: Linear Equations](./02-linear-equations.md)
The foundation of linear models. Master solving equations and systems that form the basis of linear regression, the backbone of countless ML applications.

### [Chapter 3: Polynomials](./03-polynomials.md)
Beyond straight lines. Understand polynomial structure, roots, and factoring—essential for polynomial regression, kernel methods, and understanding model complexity.

### [Chapter 4: Exponentials and Logarithms](./04-exponentials-and-logarithms.md)
The mathematics of growth and scale. These functions are ubiquitous in ML: from softmax activations to cross-entropy loss to learning rate schedules.

### [Chapter 5: Inequalities](./05-inequalities.md)
Defining boundaries and constraints. Essential for understanding optimization constraints, support vector machines, and feasible regions in linear programming.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this level, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Order of operations (PEMDAS)
- Working with fractions and decimals
- Basic number theory concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this level, you will be able to:

1. **Translate real-world problems** into algebraic expressions
2. **Solve equations and systems** both analytically and computationally
3. **Factor and manipulate polynomials** to simplify complex expressions
4. **Apply exponential and logarithmic transformations** for scaling and probability
5. **Work with inequalities** to define and understand constraints

## How to Use This Level

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Intuition**: Start with plain English explanations and analogies
2. **Visual Explanation**: See concepts through diagrams and visual representations
3. **Mathematical Foundation**: Dive into formal definitions and formulas
4. **Code Examples**: Implement concepts in Python with NumPy
5. **ML Relevance**: Connect directly to machine learning applications
6. **Exercises**: Practice with guided problems

We recommend working through chapters sequentially, as concepts build upon each other. However, each chapter is also designed to be self-contained for reference.

## The Bridge to Linear Algebra

This level prepares you for Level 3: Linear Algebra. The scalar operations you learn here—working with single numbers and simple equations—will extend to vectors and matrices, where you'll manipulate entire arrays of numbers simultaneously. Think of algebra as learning to speak; linear algebra is learning to address crowds.

## Let's Begin

Mathematics is a skill built through practice, not passive reading. Work through the examples, write the code, and solve the exercises. The investment you make here will pay dividends throughout your ML journey.
