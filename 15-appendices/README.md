# Appendices

> **Quick-reference material you will reach for repeatedly.** These appendices collect the symbols, formulas, distributions, and code patterns scattered across all 14 levels into lookup-friendly tables. Keep them open in a second tab while you read.

## Contents

| Appendix | Title | What It Is |
|----------|-------|------------|
| A | [Greek Alphabet & Pronunciation](A-greek-alphabet.md) | Every Greek letter you will encounter in ML papers, with pronunciation, LaTeX command, and typical meaning |
| B | [Notation Quick Reference](B-notation-reference.md) | A symbol-to-meaning dictionary organized by topic -- sets, logic, linear algebra, calculus, probability |
| C | [Key Theorems & Identities](C-key-theorems-and-identities.md) | The most referenced results in one place: Bayes' theorem, chain rule, matrix identities, trig identities, and more |
| D | [Probability Distributions](D-probability-distributions.md) | One-page card per distribution -- PDF/PMF, mean, variance, shape, and when you will see it in ML |
| E | [Matrix Cookbook](E-matrix-cookbook.md) | Matrix calculus rules, derivative identities, decomposition properties, and trace/determinant tricks |
| F | [Calculus Reference](F-calculus-reference.md) | Common derivatives, integrals, series expansions, and differentiation rules in compact table form |
| G | [NumPy / SciPy / PyTorch Cheat Sheet](G-numpy-scipy-pytorch-cheatsheet.md) | "I know the math, how do I write it in code?" -- maps mathematical operations to library calls |
| H | [Glossary](H-glossary.md) | Definitions of every technical term used in the book, cross-referenced to the chapter where it first appears |
| I | [Recommended Reading](I-recommended-reading.md) | Annotated bibliography organized by topic, with suggested learning paths through external resources |

## How to Use These Appendices

**While reading a chapter**: Keep Appendix A (Greek letters) and B (notation) open. When you hit an unfamiliar symbol, look it up immediately instead of guessing.

**While coding**: Keep Appendix G (code cheat sheet) open. It bridges the gap between the formula on the page and the NumPy call you need to type.

**While reading papers**: Appendices B, C, and D will cover 90% of the notation and background results that papers assume you already know.

**While debugging ML code**: Appendix E (matrix cookbook) and F (calculus reference) help you verify gradient derivations and matrix operations quickly.

**While reviewing concepts**: Appendix H (glossary) gives you precise definitions without re-reading entire chapters.
